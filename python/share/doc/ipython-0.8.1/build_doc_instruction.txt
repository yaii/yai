How to generate IPython documentation
=====================================

The doc is written using lyx http://www.lyx.org, which is a gui for latex
documents. LyX also requires a latex installation.

The file manual_base.lyx is the template file that should be edited if you
want to do changes to the docs.

A final version is generated by running 

./update_manual.py

or 

ipython update_manual.py

(note that "python update_manual.py" won't work, it's an ipython script!)

The script update_manual.py will insert the current version number into the
template and also generate magic.tex, a file containing documentation for
the doc strings of the magic commands.

The script creates manual.lyx which can be opened by lyx to generate pdf or
postscript versions of the docs.

update_magic.sh and update_version.sh work too, but are slated for
deprecation.
