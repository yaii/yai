Threading support
</H1>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">WARNING:</SPAN> The threading support is still somewhat experimental,
and it has only seen reasonable testing under Linux. Threaded code
is particularly tricky to debug, and it tends to show extremely platform-dependent
behavior. Since I only have access to Linux machines, I will have
to rely on user's experiences and assistance for this area of IPython
to improve under other platforms.

<P>
IPython, via the <TT>-gthread</TT> , <TT>-qthread</TT> and <TT>-wthread</TT>
options (described in Sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#sec:threading-opts">5.1</A>), can run in
multithreaded mode to support pyGTK, Qt and WXPython applications
respectively. These GUI toolkits need to control the python main loop
of execution, so under a normal Python interpreter, starting a pyGTK,
Qt or WXPython application will immediately freeze the shell. 

<P>
IPython, with one of these options (you can only use one at a time),
separates the graphical loop and IPython's code execution run into
different threads. This allows you to test interactively (with <TT>%run</TT>,
for example) your GUI code without blocking.

<P>
A nice mini-tutorial on using IPython along with the Qt Designer application
is available at the SciPy wiki: <TT><A NAME="tex2html20"
  HREF="http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Qt_with_IPython_and_Designer">http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Qt_with_IPython_and_Designer</A></TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000131000000000000000">
Tk issues</A>
</H2>

<P>
As indicated in Sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#sec:threading-opts">5.1</A>, a special <TT>-tk</TT>
option is provided to try and allow Tk graphical applications to coexist
interactively with WX, Qt or GTK ones. Whether this works at all,
however, is very platform and configuration dependent. Please experiment
with simple test cases before committing to using this combination
of Tk and GTK/Qt/WX threading in a production environment.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000132000000000000000">
Signals and Threads</A>
</H2>

<P>
When any of the thread systems (GTK, Qt or WX) are active, either
directly or via <TT>-pylab</TT> with a threaded backend, it is impossible
to interrupt long-running Python code via <TT>Ctrl-C</TT>. IPython
can not pass the KeyboardInterrupt exception (or the underlying <TT>SIGINT</TT>)
across threads, so any long-running process started from IPython will
run to completion, or will have to be killed via an external (OS-based)
mechanism.

<P>
To the best of my knowledge, this limitation is imposed by the Python
interpreter itself, and it comes from the difficulty of writing portable
signal/threaded code. If any user is an expert on this topic and can
suggest a better solution, I would love to hear about it. In the IPython
sources, look at the <TT>Shell.py</TT> module, and in particular at
the <TT>runcode()</TT> method. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000133000000000000000">
I/O pitfalls</A>
</H2>

<P>
Be mindful that the Python interpreter switches between threads every
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$N$"></SPAN> bytecodes, where the default value as of Python&nbsp;2.3 is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$N=100.$"></SPAN>
This value can be read by using the <TT>sys.getcheckinterval()</TT>
function, and it can be reset via <TT>sys.setcheckinterval(<SPAN  CLASS="textit">N</SPAN>)</TT>.
This switching of threads can cause subtly confusing effects if one
of your threads is doing file I/O. In text mode, most systems only
flush file buffers when they encounter a <TT>`&#92;n'</TT>.
An instruction as simple as&nbsp;
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;print &gt;&gt; filehandle, ``hello world''</TT>
<BR>
actually consists of several bytecodes, so it is possible that the
newline does not reach your file before the next thread switch. Similarly,
if you are writing to a file in binary mode, the file won't be flushed
until the buffer fills, and your other thread may see apparently truncated
files. 

<P>
For this reason, if you are using IPython's thread support and have
(for example) a GUI application which will read data generated by
files written to from the IPython thread, the safest approach is to
open all of your files in unbuffered mode (the third argument to the
<TT>file/open</TT> function is the buffering value):
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;filehandle = open(filename,mode,0)</TT>

<P>
This is obviously a brute force way of avoiding race conditions with
the file buffering. If you want to do it cleanly, and you have a resource
which is being shared by the interactive IPython loop and your GUI
thread, you should really handle it with thread locking and syncrhonization
properties. The Python documentation discusses these.
