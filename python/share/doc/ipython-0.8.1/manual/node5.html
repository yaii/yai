Command-line use</A>
</H1>

<P>
You start IPython with the command:

<P>
<TT>$ ipython [options] files</TT>

<P>
If invoked with no options, it executes all the files listed in sequence
and drops you into the interpreter while still acknowledging any options
you may have set in your ipythonrc file. This behavior is different
from standard Python, which when called as <TT>python -i</TT> will
only execute one file and ignore your configuration setup.

<P>
Please note that some of the configuration options are not available
at the command line, simply because they are not practical here. Look
into your ipythonrc configuration file for details on those. This
file typically installed in the <TT>$HOME/.ipython</TT> directory.
For Windows users, <TT>$HOME</TT> resolves to <TT>C:&#92;&#92;Documents
and Settings&#92;&#92;YourUserName</TT> in most
instances. In the rest of this text, we will refer to this directory
as <TT>IPYTHONDIR</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:threading-opts"></A>
<BR>
Special Threading Options
</H2>

<P>
The following special options are ONLY valid at the beginning of the
command line, and not later. This is because they control the initial-
ization of ipython itself, before the normal option-handling mechanism
is active.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-gthread,&nbsp;-qthread,&nbsp;-q4thread,&nbsp;-wthread,&nbsp;-pylab:</SPAN></TT>] Only
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">one</SPAN> of these can be given, and it can only be given as the
first option passed to IPython (it will have no effect in any other
position). They provide threading support for the GTK, Qt (versions
3 and 4) and WXPython toolkits, and for the matplotlib library.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] With any of the first four options, IPython starts running
a separate thread for the graphical toolkit's operation, so that you
can open and control graphical elements from within an IPython command
line, without blocking. All four provide essentially the same functionality,
respectively for GTK, Qt3, Qt4 and WXWidgets (via their Python interfaces).
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Note that with <TT>-wthread</TT>, you can additionally use
the -wxversion option to request a specific version of wx to be used.
This requires that you have the <TT>wxversion</TT> Python module installed,
which is part of recent wxPython distributions.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] If <TT>-pylab</TT> is given, IPython loads special support
for the mat plotlib library (<TT><A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net</A></TT>),
allowing interactive usage of any of its backends as defined in the
user's <TT>~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc</TT> file. It
automatically activates GTK, Qt or WX threading for IPyhton if the
choice of matplotlib backend requires it. It also modifies the <TT>%run</TT>
command to correctly execute (without blocking) any matplotlib-based
script which calls <TT>show()</TT> at the end. 
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-tk</SPAN></TT>] The <TT>-g/q/q4/wthread</TT> options, and
<TT>-pylab</TT> (if matplotlib is configured to use GTK, Qt3, Qt4
or WX), will normally block Tk graphical interfaces. This means that
when either GTK, Qt or WX threading is active, any attempt to open
a Tk GUI will result in a dead window, and possibly cause the Python
interpreter to crash. An extra option, <TT>-tk</TT>, is available
to address this issue. It can <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> be given as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">second</SPAN>
option after any of the above (<TT>-gthread</TT>, <TT>-wthread</TT>
or <TT>-pylab</TT>).
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] If <TT>-tk</TT> is given, IPython will try to coordinate Tk
threading with GTK, Qt or WX. This is however potentially unreliable,
and you will have to test on your platform and Python configuration
to determine whether it works for you. Debian users have reported
success, apparently due to the fact that Debian builds all of Tcl,
Tk, Tkinter and Python with pthreads support. Under other Linux environments
(such as Fedora Core 2/3), this option has caused random crashes and
lockups of the Python interpreter. Under other operating systems (Mac
OSX and Windows), you'll need to try it to find out, since currently
no user reports are available.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] There is unfortunately no way for IPython to determine at
run time whether <TT>-tk</TT> will work reliably or not, so you will
need to do some experiments before relying on it for regular work. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:cmd-line-opts"></A>
<BR>
Regular Options
</H2>

<P>
After the above threading options have been given, regular options
can follow in any order. All options can be abbreviated to their shortest
non-ambiguous form and are case-sensitive. One or two dashes can be
used. Some options have an alternate short form, indicated after a
<TT>|</TT>.

<P>
Most options can also be set from your ipythonrc configuration file.
See the provided example for more details on what the options do.
Options given at the command line override the values set in the ipythonrc
file.

<P>
All options with a <TT>[no]</TT> prepended can be specified in negated
form (<TT>-nooption</TT> instead of <TT>-option</TT>) to turn the
feature off.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-help</SPAN></TT>:] print a help message and exit.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-pylab:</SPAN></TT>] this can <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> be given as the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">first</SPAN> option passed to IPython (it will have no effect in any
other position). It adds special support for the matplotlib library
(http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net <TT><A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net</A></TT>),
allowing interactive usage of any of its backends as defined in the
user's <TT>.matplotlibrc</TT> file. It automatically activates GTK
or WX threading for IPyhton if the choice of matplotlib backend requires
it. It also modifies the <TT>%run</TT> command to correctly execute
(without blocking) any matplotlib-based script which calls <TT>show()</TT>
at the end. See Sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node15.html#sec:matplotlib-support">15</A> for more details.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-autocall</SPAN></TT>] <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">&lt;val&gt;:</SPAN></TT> Make IPython
automatically call any callable object even if you didn't type explicit
parentheses. For example, `str 43' becomes `str(43)' automatically.
The value can be `0' to disable the feature, `1' for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">smart</SPAN>
autocall, where it is not applied if there are no more arguments on
the line, and `2' for <SPAN  CLASS="textit">full</SPAN> autocall, where all callable objects
are automatically called (even if no arguments are present). The default
is `1'.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]autoindent:</SPAN></TT>] Turn automatic indentation
on/off.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]automagic</SPAN>:</TT>] make magic commands
automatic (without needing their first character to be <TT>%</TT>).
Type <TT>%magic</TT> at the IPython prompt for more information.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]autoedit_syntax:</SPAN></TT>] When a syntax error
occurs after editing a file, automatically open the file to the trouble
causing line for convenient fixing. 
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]banner</SPAN>:</TT>] Print the initial information
banner (default on).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-c&nbsp;&lt;command&gt;:</SPAN></TT>] execute the given command string,
and set sys.argv to <TT>['c']</TT>. This is similar to the <TT>-c</TT>
option in the normal Python interpreter. 
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-cache_size|cs&nbsp;&lt;n&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] size of the
output cache (maximum number of entries to hold in memory). The default
is 1000, you can change it permanently in your config file. Setting
it to 0 completely disables the caching system, and the minimum value
accepted is 20 (if you provide a value less than 20, it is reset to
0 and a warning is issued) This limit is defined because otherwise
you'll spend more time re-flushing a too small cache than working.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-classic|cl</SPAN>:</TT>] Gives IPython a similar
feel to the classic Python prompt.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-colors&nbsp;&lt;scheme&gt;:</SPAN></TT>] Color scheme for prompts
and exception reporting. Currently implemented: NoColor, Linux and
LightBG.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]color_info:</SPAN></TT>] IPython can display information
about objects via a set of functions, and optionally can use colors
for this, syntax highlighting source code and various other elements.
However, because this information is passed through a pager (like
'less') and many pagers get confused with color codes, this option
is off by default. You can test it and turn it on permanently in your
ipythonrc file if it works for you. As a reference, the 'less' pager
supplied with Mandrake 8.2 works ok, but that in RedHat 7.2 doesn't.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Test it and turn it on permanently if it works with your system.
The magic function <TT>%color_info</TT> allows you to toggle this
interactively for testing.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]debug</SPAN></TT>:] Show information about the loading
process. Very useful to pin down problems with your configuration
files or to get details about session restores.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]deep_reload</SPAN>:</TT>] IPython can use
the <TT>deep_reload</TT> module which reloads changes in modules
recursively (it replaces the <TT>reload()</TT> function, so you don't
need to change anything to use it). <TT>deep_reload()</TT> forces
a full reload of modules whose code may have changed, which the default
<TT>reload()</TT> function does not.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] When deep_reload is off, IPython will use the normal <TT>reload()</TT>,
but deep_reload will still be available as <TT>dreload()</TT>. This
feature is off by default [which means that you have both normal
<TT>reload()</TT> and <TT>dreload()</TT>].
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-editor&nbsp;&lt;name&gt;</SPAN></TT>:] Which editor to use with the
<TT>%edit</TT> command. By default, IPython will honor your <TT>EDITOR</TT>
environment variable (if not set, vi is the Unix default and notepad
the Windows one). Since this editor is invoked on the fly by IPython
and is meant for editing small code snippets, you may want to use
a small, lightweight editor here (in case your default <TT>EDITOR</TT>
is something like Emacs).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-ipythondir&nbsp;&lt;name&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] name of your
IPython configuration directory <TT>IPYTHONDIR</TT>. This can also
be specified through the environment variable <TT>IPYTHONDIR</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-log|l</SPAN></TT>:] generate a log file of all input. The
file is named <TT>ipython_log.py</TT> in your current directory (which
prevents logs from multiple IPython sessions from trampling each other).
You can use this to later restore a session by loading your logfile
as a file to be executed with option <TT>-logplay</TT> (see below).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-logfile|lf&nbsp;&lt;name&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] specify the name
of your logfile.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-logplay|lp&nbsp;&lt;name&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] you can replay
a previous log. For restoring a session as close as possible to the
state you left it in, use this option (don't just run the logfile).
With <TT>-logplay</TT>, IPython will try to reconstruct the previous
working environment in full, not just execute the commands in the
logfile.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] When a session is restored, logging is automatically turned
on again with the name of the logfile it was invoked with (it is read
from the log header). So once you've turned logging on for a session,
you can quit IPython and reload it as many times as you want and it
will continue to log its history and restore from the beginning every
time.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Caveats: there are limitations in this option. The history
variables <TT>_i*</TT>,<TT>_*</TT> and <TT>_dh</TT> don't get
restored properly. In the future we will try to implement full session
saving by writing and retrieving a 'snapshot' of the memory state
of IPython. But our first attempts failed because of inherent limitations
of Python's Pickle module, so this may have to wait.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]messages</SPAN>:</TT>] Print messages which
IPython collects about its startup process (default on).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]pdb</SPAN></TT>:] Automatically call the pdb debugger
after every uncaught exception. If you are used to debugging using
pdb, this puts you automatically inside of it after any call (either
in IPython or in code called by it) which triggers an exception which
goes uncaught.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]pprint</SPAN>:</TT>] ipython can optionally
use the pprint (pretty printer) module for displaying results. pprint
tends to give a nicer display of nested data structures. If you like
it, you can turn it on permanently in your config file (default off).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-profile|p</SPAN></TT>] <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">&lt;name&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>
assume that your config file is <TT>ipythonrc-&lt;name&gt;</TT> (looks in
current dir first, then in <TT>IPYTHONDIR</TT>). This is a quick way
to keep and load multiple config files for different tasks, especially
if you use the include option of config files. You can keep a basic
<TT>IPYTHONDIR/ipythonrc</TT> file and then have other 'profiles'
which include this one and load extra things for particular tasks.
For example:
</LI>
<LI>[<TT>&nbsp;</TT>] 1. <TT>$HOME/.ipython/ipythonrc</TT> : load basic
things you always want.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT>&nbsp;</TT>] 2. <TT>$HOME/.ipython/ipythonrc-math</TT> : load
(1) and basic math-related modules. 
</LI>
<LI>[<TT>&nbsp;</TT>] 3. <TT>$HOME/.ipython/ipythonrc-numeric</TT> : load
(1) and Numeric and plotting modules.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Since it is possible to create an endless loop by having circular
file inclusions, IPython will stop if it reaches 15 recursive inclusions.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-prompt_in1|pi1&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;:</SPAN></TT>] Specify the string
used for input prompts. Note that if you are using numbered prompts,
the number is represented with a '&#92;#' in the string.
Don't forget to quote strings with spaces embedded in them. Default:
'<TT>In&nbsp;[&#92;#]:</TT>'. Sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#sec:prompts">7.2</A> discusses
in detail all the available escapes to customize your prompts.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-prompt_in2|pi2&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;:</SPAN></TT>] Similar to the
previous option, but used for the continuation prompts. The special
sequence '<TT>&#92;D</TT>' is similar to '<TT>&#92;#</TT>',
but with all digits replaced dots (so you can have your continuation
prompt aligned with your input prompt). Default: '<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&#92;D.:</TT>'
(note three spaces at the start for alignment with '<TT>In&nbsp;[&#92;#]</TT>').
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-prompt_out|po&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;:</SPAN></TT>] String used for
output prompts, also uses numbers like <TT>prompt_in1</TT>. Default:
'<TT>Out[&#92;#]:</TT>'
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-quick</SPAN></TT>:] start in bare bones mode (no config
file loaded).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-rcfile&nbsp;&lt;name&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] name of your IPython
resource configuration file. Normally IPython loads ipythonrc (from
current directory) or <TT>IPYTHONDIR/ipythonrc</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] If the loading of your config file fails, IPython starts with
a bare bones configuration (no modules loaded at all).
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-[no]readline</SPAN></TT>:] use the readline library,
which is needed to support name completion and command history, among
other things. It is enabled by default, but may cause problems for
users of X/Emacs in Python comint or shell buffers.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Note that X/Emacs 'eterm' buffers (opened with <TT>M-x&nbsp;term</TT>)
support IPython's readline and syntax coloring fine, only 'emacs'
(<TT>M-x&nbsp;shell</TT> and <TT>C-c&nbsp;!</TT>) buffers do not.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-screen_length|sl&nbsp;&lt;n&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] number of
lines of your screen. This is used to control printing of very long
strings. Strings longer than this number of lines will be sent through
a pager instead of directly printed.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] The default value for this is 0, which means IPython will
auto-detect your screen size every time it needs to print certain
potentially long strings (this doesn't change the behavior of the
'print' keyword, it's only triggered internally). If for some reason
this isn't working well (it needs curses support), specify it yourself.
Otherwise don't change the default.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-separate_in|si&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] separator
before input prompts. Default: '<TT>&#92;n</TT>'
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-separate_out|so&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;</SPAN></TT>:] separator before
output prompts. Default: nothing.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-separate_out2|so2&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] separator
after output prompts. Default: nothing.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] For these three options, use the value 0 to specify no separator.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-nosep</SPAN>:</TT>] shorthand for <TT>'-SeparateIn
0 -SeparateOut 0 -SeparateOut2 0'</TT>. Simply removes all input/output
separators.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-upgrade</SPAN></TT>:] allows you to upgrade your <TT>IPYTHONDIR</TT>
configuration when you install a new version of IPython. Since new
versions may include new command line options or example files, this
copies updated ipythonrc-type files. However, it backs up (with a
<TT>.old</TT> extension) all files which it overwrites so that you
can merge back any customizations you might have in your personal
files.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Version</SPAN>:</TT>] print version information
and exit.
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-wxversion&nbsp;&lt;string&gt;:</SPAN></TT>] Select a specific version
of wxPython (used in conjunction with <TT>-wthread</TT>). Requires
the wxversion module, part of recent wxPython distributions
</LI>
<LI>[<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-xmode&nbsp;&lt;modename&gt;</SPAN>:</TT>] Mode for exception
reporting.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Valid modes: Plain, Context and Verbose.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Plain: similar to python's normal traceback printing.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Context: prints 5 lines of context source code around each
line in the traceback.
</LI>
<LI>[&nbsp;] Verbose: similar to Context, but additionally prints the variables
currently visible where the exception happened (shortening their strings
if too long). This can potentially be very slow, if you happen to
have a huge data structure whose string representation is complex
to compute. Your computer may appear to freeze for a while with cpu
usage at 100%. If this occurs, you can cancel the traceback with
Ctrl-C (maybe hitting it more than once).
</LI>
