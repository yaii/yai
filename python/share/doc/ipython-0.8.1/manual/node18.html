Origins</A>
</H2>

<P>
The current IPython system grew out of the following three projects:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>[ipython] by Fernando P&#233;rez. I was working on adding Mathematica-type
prompts and a flexible configuration system (something better than
<TT>$PYTHONSTARTUP</TT>) to the standard Python interactive interpreter.
</LI>
<LI>[IPP] by Janko Hauser. Very well organized, great usability. Had
an old help system. IPP was used as the `container' code into which
I added the functionality from ipython and LazyPython.
</LI>
<LI>[LazyPython] by Nathan Gray. Simple but <SPAN  CLASS="textit">very</SPAN> powerful. The
quick syntax (auto parens, auto quotes) and verbose/colored tracebacks
were all taken from here.
</LI>
</UL>When I found out (see sec. <A HREF="node20.html#figgins">20</A>) about IPP and LazyPython
I tried to join all three into a unified system. I thought this could
provide a very nice working environment, both for regular programming
and scientific computing: shell-like features, IDL/Matlab numerics,
Mathematica-type prompt history and great object introspection and
help facilities. I think it worked reasonably well, though it was
a lot more work than I had initially planned.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000182000000000000000">
Current status</A>
</H2>

<P>
The above listed features work, and quite well for the most part.
But until a major internal restructuring is done (see below), only
bug fixing will be done, no other features will be added (unless very
minor and well localized in the cleaner parts of the code).

<P>
IPython consists of some 18000 lines of pure python code, of which
roughly two thirds is reasonably clean. The rest is, messy code which
needs a massive restructuring before any further major work is done.
Even the messy code is fairly well documented though, and most of
the problems in the (non-existent) class design are well pointed to
by a PyChecker run. So the rewriting work isn't that bad, it will
just be time-consuming.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000183000000000000000">
Future</A>
</H2>

<P>
See the separate <TT>new_design</TT> document for details. Ultimately,
I would like to see IPython become part of the standard Python distribution
as a `big brother with batteries' to the standard Python interactive
interpreter. But that will never happen with the current state of
the code, so all contributions are welcome.
